- A well-thought user experience

__ğŸš« Don'ts__

- Excessive effort in styling
- Features which don't directly answer the above statement
- Over-engineer your prototype

## Deliverable

- The codebase should be pushed on the current GitHub private repository.
- 2 or 3 user stories that address the statement in your repo's `README.md`.
- The application accessible online (a personal server, fly.io or something else).
- Submission of the above via [this form](https://forms.gle/siH7Rezuq2V1mUJGA).

## Data

Please start from the following dataset to perform the assignment:
[english-language recipes](https://pennylane-interviewing-assets-20220328.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/recipes-en.json.gz) scraped from www.allrecipes.com with [recipe-scrapers](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers)

Download it with this command if the above link doesn't work:
```sh textWrap
wget https://pennylane-interviewing-assets-20220328.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/recipes-en.json.gz && gzip -dc recipes-en.json.gz > recipes-en.json
